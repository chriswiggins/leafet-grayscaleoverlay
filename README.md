# leafet-grayscaleoverlay
Layer that can be added to leaflet that applies a grayscale mask over the map (at 80% grayscale)

Add CSS and JS to your `<head>` or include via a compiler (like webpack)

If you wish to change the amount of "grayscale", just override the CSS (or provide your own). I've found 80% provides enough colour to distinguish features
